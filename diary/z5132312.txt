Week 1
Group formed. Jira & Github accounts created. I looked through the 8 topics and chose 2 topics which are read recommend and skills backpack. My group had a discussion then we decided to choose read recommend as our project topic. Next week we will focus on the proposal.

Week 2
We had a discussion about our proposal, we divided it into some parts and each group number need to finish their own work. My part is ‘background’ and ‘existing systems and drawbacks’. Next week I will know more information about our project and finish my part.

Week 3
I finished my part and our group made the final version proposal. I thought about the database, maybe use the mongodb + mongoengine ORM to build the model is a good choice. Next week I will have a discussion with my teammates to decide which tools are good choices for us to finish this project.
